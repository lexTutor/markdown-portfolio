Lex is a **_Engineer_**, **_writer_**, **_Business_man_** has a strong passion for **_socio-political_** reforms in Nigeria and Africa and i am of the opinion that such a reform will come through the aid of advanced __technology__ especially through **software engineering**. As one who will be involved in implementing such reforms it has become expedient that I have sufficient knowledge of a many programming languages as possible and this has led me to do some **_"python dancing_**(only Nigerians will understand that) and i've also been learning **_javascript_** and also **_git_**. I must say i'm enjoying the experience. Thank you for taking out time to read this.
